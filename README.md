# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a sorting visualizer. I wanted to build this to easily explain the
sorting algorithms in a visual form.

This project currently contains the following sorting algorithms :
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

In the future I may add these sorting algorithms :
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort (~~maybe?~~)

TechStack Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
